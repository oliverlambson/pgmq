Postgres has a message-queue-like functionality with `NOTIFY` (publish) and `LISTEN`
(subscribe). It seems unnecessary to run a whole separate message queue broker if I only
have a couple simple use cases (namely, one or two workers listening to a queue where
the publishers are either a web server or cronjobs).

I don't really want my cronjobs for messages to run on webservers or workers, because
they're likely to have downtime since I will inevitably mess something up (i.e.,
unrelated bugs cause the server with the cronjob to go down, meaning the job's never
scheduledâ€”that silent failure will be hard to catch). The database is already a critical
single-point of failure for whatever app, and it's probably the least likely to go down,
so why not run them there? Cron NOTIFYs/INSERTs into a table are simple enough that
running them on the db seems like minimal additional risk.

I also don't want my messages to disappear if a job fails or if a worker goes down or if
there are no workers at all. So my actual queue should be a persistent table of
messages. I want my workers to know when new messages are added to the table, so I can
send a `NOTIFY` on a channel that they `LISTEN` to after an insert has happened in the
message table.

I don't want multiple listening workers to process the same message, so I'll have a way
to lock messages. The first worker to successfully lock the message will do the work,
and if a worker tries to lock a message and fails, it won't be able to do the work.

After the message lock is acquired, it can reach a terminal state in a few ways:

- If the worker successfully does the work, it can delete the message from the message
  table and optionally persist the message and it's results to a message_archive table.
- If the worker hits an error, it can choose to either (1) delete the message from the
  message table and optionally persist the message and it's errors to a message_failures
  table; or (2) release the lock and let a worker have another go.
- If the worker falls over, the lock will expire. At that point the message should be
  either released back to the message queue or be dumped into the message_failures
  table.

todo:

- [x] postgres with pg_cron installed
- [x] tables for messages and message archive
- [x] notify to channel on insert into messages
- [ ] handle timed out locks (notify to different channel? move to dead letter table?)
- [x] worker to listen for notifies and process messages
- [ ] cron job to insert into messages
- [ ] message schema in example
- [ ] docs
- [ ] example in Go

## Listen and Notify

```sql
LISTEN channel;
NOTIFY channel, 'message';
```

## Scheduled messages

`pg_cron` writes messages to message table. Then handled just like a normal
message. i.e., `pg_cron` is another message source and there's nothing special
about it.

## Custom Postgres image

Need to install pg_cron which doesn't come with standard postgres image.

- Initialisation: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md#initialization-scripts

  > After the entrypoint calls initdb to create the default postgres user and

- Configuration: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md#database-configuration

## Running a message worker

```sh
# shell 1: postgres logs
docker compose up
# shell 2: worker to LISTEN for notifies
source example/.venv/bin/activate
worker
# shell 3: insert a message (sends NOTIFY)
example/insert.sh
# shell 4: psql interactive session to inspect tables
psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
postgres=# select * from messages.message;
postgres=# select * from messages.message_archive;
```
